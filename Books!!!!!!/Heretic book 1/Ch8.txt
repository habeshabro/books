Chapter eight

      I woke up at the inn I was staying at, and I wore the brand new cotton clothes I bought yesterday. With my money problems fixed I could focus on the really important tasks, and no task is currently more important than to find out what the hell happened in the last seven centuries. Thankfully there was a library behind the large mansion and anybody who can afford the five silver entrance fee could enter.

       So that morning I put away most of my equipment, pocketed five silver , and ran to the library. At the door the guard was surprised anybody would pay the exorbitant prices to read books , but he was there to collect the tolls not comment so he didn't say anything. Inside I was met by an old librarian, who told me the rules of the library, basically no stealing or damaging the books, no loud noises, put the books back where you found them.

      I immediately went to the catalog , found the history section and started reading. Although heavily biased, 9 days and 45 silvers later I put together a pretty accurate of what probably happened.

      It all started with a girl named Sofia. She was the first person able to use mana. For years she went around the world healing people from things like cancer and Ebola with a simple wave of her hand. When asked how she was able to perform such miracles she replied " god told me to heal people so I heal people. " Everybody was in an uproar, was she really some sort of saint or was this a trick?

      But slowly other people started exhibiting powers. They weren't the normal people but the people who have been marginalized and ridiculed for their weird and strange beliefs, and now the wiccans, witches , druids , and witch doctors started to weild amazing and terrifying powers .


      Putin was the first to capitalize on this new source of power, he made the durnoy glaz or the evil eye coven. Steeped in the darkest form of sorcery and sacrifice , they were given free reign to do whatever they wanted. Other countries soon followed suit and established institutions to control the magical element. Chief among them was the mage council in Montreal Canada, and the wiccan sisterhood in Europe. Everything seemed to be going fine except that several incidents kept occurring around the world to remind the world that there were extremely dangerous individuals among them, like when the aborigeni with the help of their shamans massacred almost all of the white population and took back Australia. But the straw that broke the camels back was the New York tragedy. A group of drunk teens successfully summoned a demon that butchered thousands of people before the mage council could contain it. Suddenly it was like 9/11 allover again. Antimagic legislations were passed, and suddenly hate crimes and discrimination spread. 

        In the middle of this chaos a lab in Denmark discovered that mana behaves strangely in intense magnetic fields and used this fact to develop counter measures for magic. Using this technology governments started cracking down on magic everywhere. And one fateful Friday night an overzealous Colombian officer ,using the new technology, accidentally killed the innocent Sofia, and that was all it took.

        The magical community had found its Joan of arc, the martyr they could all rally behind. They made the church of the holy saint Sofia and proclaimed anything to do with technology as evil. The wiccan sisterhood made a grand working with all the covens in Europe present. The result, an electro magnetic pulse that swallowed the entire world and broke every chip in the world. Without their sophisticated weapons the entire world's army was defeated by the end of the week. All the intellectuals in the world were hunted as heretics, all books about technology and science were burned. In the end the world was divided into 8 to be governed as thus, the durnoy glaz took Russia, the druids claimed great Britain, the martial masters took Asia, the aborigeni took Australia, a person claiming to be the reincarnation of king Solomon took Africa,the mage council took north america, finally the bestial tribes from the amazon took south america leaving Europe to the wiccan sisterhood.

        All scientific knowledge concerning certain fields were systematically purged from humanity. And the most influential church in the world, the saint Sofia church makes sure that it remains that way.
