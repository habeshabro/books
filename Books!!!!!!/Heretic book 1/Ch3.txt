Chapter three

  "What the fuck is wrong with you? I told you repeatedly not to use the god's sight until I gave you permission. Next time I'm not going to save your sorry ass, I'm just going to watch your liquefied brain leak out your ears. Do you understand how stupid that stunt you pulled was?"

  "Before we start let's button down some terminologies. As I have already mentioned I call the extra dimensional energies mana. The fifth dimensional space I call the informational ether or simply ether. The reason I'm using this terms is related to my research regarding mana and will become abundantly clear later, but first we have to get you used to your new body and all it's bells and whistles."

     "All the problems with the cerebral palsy are obviously gone, but that was finished 5 years into the reforging process, so I made a few adjustments while I was waiting 700 years for someone to dig you out. First is the most obvious, I modified your looks to be attractive to the majority of the female population, just think of it as a thank you for letting me live inside of your head . The second modification I made is that instead of flushing the nanites out of your system after the process was complete, I integrated them into your normal biological makeup. Now not only does each cell contain a certain amount of nanites your bone marrow contains specialized cells that are dedicated to producing nanites. Third biggest modification is the mana refining organ where your appendix used to be, and finally I gave you a sparkly pair of eyes that can see into the ether."

   I whistled appreciatively as she listed out to me what sounded like a grocery list for super powers, basically Jules just told me that I had super looks, super healing, magic , and eyes that can see into the very fabric of the universe. Is it wrong to say I'm in love with my A.I. ?

 "But listen carefully to what I am about to say now, under no circumstances are you allowed to use fifth dimensional vision, or as I like to call it god sight, until I say so OK?"

  "Sure sure Jules , I won't mess with the eyes . Now show me how to use magic!" I was really excited to start with the magic lessons. I won't publicly admit it but I was a giant Harry Potter nerd as a kid , and this was something of a childhood dream come true.

   " Believe it or not the best ways to manipulate mana have already been discovered. Things that you used to think were a pointless waste of time. For example most of the rituals in the Wicca and druid systems actually work now. The pentagram for example is a rather good way to gather and funnel mana."

 "Please tell me I don't have to sift through a bunch of rubbish to be able to use magic."

 " Of course not, I have been cataloging all the relevant symbols and their uses for the last century, you just have to figure out how to use them. Besides before all this could happen you have to learn to manipulate mana inside of yourself, on that end I have prepared a program of meditation and tai-chi to hone your control. I have a compilation of lessons from masters of both fields ."

   Three weeks of greuilling training later I was good enough at mana manipulation to send it to specific body parts, and I was so curious about the ether that I activated god sight, almost instantly I had a massive headache and passed out. What woke me up was Julia screaming bloody murder. 

         "What the fuck is wrong with you? I told you repeatedly not to use the god's sight until I gave you permission. Next time I'm not going to save your sorry ass, I'm just going to watch your liquefied brain leak out your ears. Do you understand how stupid that stunt you pulled was?"

      " I'm sorry Jules , my curiosity got the better of me."

      "Well now that you have finished trying to kill yourself in the most painful way possible, let us start your lessons in magic. I'll give you a list of all the relevant symbols for you to study. Now start memorizing this list."

           The Egyptian ankh............. To do with life energy, combined with others could be used for combat or healing
            The pentagram.................. Used as a funnel for manna, acts somewhat like a diode and goes only one way

     It had over a hundred pages in really small font, good thing that studying is one of my strong points.
