Prologue

	Our ancestors told us the stories of the spirits. They thought us the truth of this world. They warned us not to forget.

	But a veil has fallen over the eyes of our people. We have forsaken our traditions and embraced convenience. We have lost ourselves to lies.

	Lies, all lies. 

	Remember granddaughter, your parents might tell you that the stories I tell are far fetched fairytales, but mark my words, these are not children's stories. They are our people's heritage, their inheritance to us, their successors. We are true Habesha, we are the chosen of the spirits. The ungrateful of today might spit on our culture, laugh at our traditions as outdated and stupid, but they are the stupid ones, grinning foolishly as they willingly collar themselves to their new masters. 

	Listen child, you who are a chosen of the spirits. Listen to the stories left to us by our ancestors and know the truth.

	Listen to the story of the mouse and the hawk.

	The twitchy little thing poked it's head from it's burrow, it's beady little eyes darting from side to side , it's little pink nose sniffing the air to catch a whiff of danger. Everything about this creature told a story of caution, of fear. It's claws were made for digging and foraging, not for rending flesh. It's teeth specialized in cracking nuts and chewing grass, not biting enemies. This animal was prey, bottom of the food chain, and as such it scurried and hid. 

	But as this little creature lived it's little life as nature dictated, something odd started to happen. As it hid and forged, as it cowered and ran, it's actions, it's thoughts, it's very essence sublimated into something intangible yet very real. It spawned a spirit, a spirit that was as small and meek as the animal that birthed it. 

	Unknown to the little creature below, another animal lived a very different type of life. It did not hide or cower, it flew in the sky without an ounce of fear. It's eyes did not dart around, it's gaze was steady and sharp, as sharp as it's knife like talons and hooked beak. It surveyed all below it like an emperor surveying his kingdom. It's every movement seemed languid, unhurried, yet every flap of its wing carried it forward at tremendous speed.

	The monarch of the sky looked down at the meek little creature and swooped down to capture it. The poor little creature tried to escape, but it was no use. Before it could scurry back into the safety of it's burrow, it was skewered by talons almost as big as it was. As it's last breath left it's body, a small spirit left with it.

	But the spirit didn't go far. The hunt itself was a ritual, a medium by which the meek and cowardly spirit of the mouse was torn apart and remolded by the violence of the hawk. 

	To the mundane eye, it may appear that the hawk was simply consuming the flesh of the mouse, but at the same time, it was also feasting on the spirit. The twinkle in the eyes of the hawk grew sharper as its spirit was nurtured. Invisible to the naked eye, the body of the hawk was wreathed in a pulsing red glow that got brighter as it concluded its hunt.
