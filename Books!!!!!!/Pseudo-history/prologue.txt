Prologue

	Our ancestors told us the stories of the spirits. They thought us the truth of this world. They warned us not to forget.

	But a veil has fallen over our people. We have forsaken our traditions and embraced convenience. We have lost ourselves to lies.

	Lies, all lies. 

	Remember granddaughter, your parents might tell you that the stories I tell are far fetched fairytales, but mark my words, these are not children's stories. They are our people's heritage, their inheritance to us, their successors. We are true Habesha, we are the chosen of the spirits. The ungrateful of today might spit on our culture, laugh at our traditions as outdated and stupid, but they are the stupid ones, grinning foolishly as they willingly collar themselves to their new masters. 

	Listen child, you who are a chosen of the spirits. Listen to the stories left to us by our ancestors and know the truth.

	Listen to the story of the mouse and the hawk.

	The twitchy little thing poked it's head from it's burrow, it's beady little eyes darting from side to side , it's little pink nose sniffing the air to catch a whiff of danger. Everything about this creature told a story of caution, of fear. It's claws were made for digging and foraging, not for rending flesh. It's teeth specialized in cracking nuts and chewing grass, not biting enemies. This animal was prey, bottom of the food chain, and as such it scurried and hid. 

	But as this little creature lived it's little life as nature dictated, something odd started to happen. As it hid and forged, as it cowered and ran, it's actions, it's thoughts, it's very essence sublimated into something intangible yet very real. It spawned a spirit, a spirit that was as small and meek as the animal that birthed it. 

	Unknown to the little creature below, another animal lived it's life as it saw fit. It did not hide or cower, it flew in the sky without an ounce of fear. It's eyes did not dart around, it's gaze was steady and sharp, as sharp as it's knife like talons and hooked beak. It surveyed all below it like an emperor surveying his kingdom. It's every movement seemed languid, unhurried, yet no one would describe it as lazy.
