Pseudo-History : Spirit and Flesh

	Once upon a time, in a world much like our own … a new race was born.

	A small gray mouse poked its head out of a hole, its inquisitive eyes darting here and there, searching for any possible dangers. Unfortunately for our little friend, it noticed the looming shadow behind him a bit too late and it was snatched into the air, its life being snuffed out by the razor sharp talons of its captor: a majestic red hawk. The hawk landed on the branch of its favorite tree and started enjoying its meal, its hooked beak ripping into the body of the mouse with ease. As the hawk devoured the flesh of the mouse to nourish its own body, it also consumed the spirit of the little gray mouse. 

	The hawk was a predator and the act of hunting the mouse

	The whole point of this book is to make the changes subtle. It is fiction but not really. Think of it as a thinly veiled conspiracy theory Something that people can easily mistaken as a book of new age mysticism. Something so cool and at the same time just a little off. The story will start talking about the relationship between predator and prey. It will talk about how the process of hunting and consumption itself affects the animal just as much as the physical food that the predator is consuming. Herbivors are peaceful and don’t attack unless provoked while predators are dominant and more violent. It talks about how domestication wasn’t simply the act of “devolving” from wolves to dogs but from hunters to recievers, fundementally altering the soul and spirit of the animal in question.

	This story will be a story centered around world building. It will not evolve aroun
