Chapter five

[window] Are you sure you want to sacrifice your strength to an unknown entity? [/window]

     There were no explanations, no clarifications or help options, just a simple yes or no question with the consequences being complete unknowns. 

     An ominous evil looking altar in the middle of a sinister little temple located at the center of the blighted lands, a level 450+ area, was giving him an option to 'sacrifice his strength' to someone or something he didn't know.

     The whole thing was extremely suspicious. Hidden content was usually a good thing in games but bifrost was different. If things are hidden then there is a reason that they are hidden. Usually these reasons are quite fatal to the naive user who happened to dig them up.

     Nicholas wasn't stupid. He knew that what he was doing was extremely stupid. Normally he would have refused such a choice without even thinking about it but things were different now. Satvik had told him that the only way to access the underworld to rescue Annette is to trigger a certain storyline. He refused to tell Nicholas about any specifics, the only thing he did tell him was about the small temple and how he should apply some of his blood on the altar there.

     Was it a trap? Was it a trick? It didn't really matter. Nicholas couldn't afford to turn this opportunity down to search for another one so he grit his teeth and accepted and when he did, one announcement after another started popping out in quick succession.

     [window] Congratulation! You have been chosen as the champion of a god/goddess! [/window]

     [window]WORLD WIDE ANNOUNCEMENT : A new deity has risen in the nine realms. This deity is an enemy of both the good and evil races and its only goal is the destruction of everything. A general call to arms has been issued to hunt down this deity's champion before the new deity can succeed! [/window]

     What the fuck?! Nicholas couldn't believe what had just happened. He suddenly became naked and powerless in the middle of one of the highest leveled regions in the game. In addition to that he became the enemy of every player and NPC, both good and evil.

     What the hell did he just do?
